# iotFinalArduino

In this project we connected an arduino to Microsoft Azure.

This project was inspired by Thomas Cont√©'s Blog : [Link](http://hypernephelist.com/2014/07/11/arduino-uno-azure-mobile-services.html "blog")

## The Code

Change the following lines in the .ino file :

```
byte mac[] = { 0xDC, 0xAB, 0xBA, 0xE9, 0xF8, 0x7D };
const char *server = "arduino-uno-test.azure-mobile.net";
const char *ams_key = "FTlCxxxxxxWaEtRxxxxxiMDmxxxx4";
```

* "mac" is your mac address, you could have to change it
* "server" is the address of your Microsoft Azure Mobile Service
* "ams_key" is the key to read and write on your Azure Mobile Service

## Hardware

In the following lines I describe how to assemble your Arduino's boards and sensors in order to work propaly with the .ino file.


You will need the following elements :
* Arduino Uno
* Arduino Ethernet Shield
* Grove - Starter Kit for Arduino

### Assemble
Put the Grove Base Shield above the Arduino Uno.
Connect the following sensors to the Base Shiled:
* Connect the "Temperture Sensor" to the port "A0"
* Connect the "Sound Sensor" to the port "A1"
* Connect the "Light Sensor" to the port "A2"
* Connect a "Led" to the port "D3"

Finally, put the Arduino Ethernet Shield above the Grove Base Shield.
You should now have the three boards stack together and three sensors connected to the base shield in the middle.

## Usage

Once every steps done your mobile service will fill a database every second with the datas recieve from the sensors.
